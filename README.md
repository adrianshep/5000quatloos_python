teach yourself, teach us project on the sublime nature of python

We chose Python as a subject because we liked the idea of a programming language that emphasizes readability, fewer lines of code, high extensibility and supports multiple paradigms. We became aware of Python through Blender, a long-ago Codecademy lesson and a WDI in-class exercise.

The zen of Python is captured by these aphorisms:

+ Beautiful is better than ugly
+ Explicit is better than implicit
+ Simple is better than complex
+ Complex is better than complicated
+ Readability counts
