teach yourself, teach us project on the sublime nature of python

We chose Python as a subject because we liked the idea of a programming language that emphasizes readability, fewer lines of code, high extensibility and supports multiple paradigms.

The zen of Python is captured by these aphorisms:

Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Readability counts
